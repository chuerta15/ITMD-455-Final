# ITMD 455 Final Project

## Type Of Application: Fitness
```
Our group has decided to build an application that will allow users to count their calories as well as set calendar reminders for the user to workout. 
Within the workout section of Our app we plan to help users to mark how many repetitions they had done throughout the day. 
Another advantage of our application is that within our calendar they will be able to track what days they workout as well as they can schedule the days 
that they would like to weigh in. This will help the user see whether what they are doing is working for them.
Our goal is to help motivate our users to workout and be healthier. 
```
## Overview

Our application is going to compose of a calorie counter so when a person signs in they could calculate how much calories they are consuming. 
The second page is going to have the users workout routine. This is going to have pre-set workouts and how many repetitions the user did. 
The third page of our application is going to have a calendar in which will help the user to set reminders of when to workout as well as when they would like to weigh in . 
Our last page is going to calculate the macro calories.
